The goal of this api is basically to send a combo of words.
I borrowed the existing set from Docker located here: https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go

I could have just done this API in go, since the above link practually has it done for me, but I wanted this in dotnet AND I didn't have go installed at the moment, and it was just quicker to do this than install go.
