# So while I'm a fan of the openjdk images, according to their site:
# This image is officially deprecated and all users are recommended to find and use suitable replacements ASAP.
# So I guess I need to do that.

# Also, I started from a base dockerfile here: https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/worker/Dockerfile.j
# But it did not work for various reasons, and this does. ðŸŽ‰
